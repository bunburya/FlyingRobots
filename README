CONTROLS

Basic movement buttons are:

y k u
 \|/
h-x-l
 /|\
b j n

Holding shift while pressing any of the above also moves up the z-axis.
Holding ctrl while pressing any of the above also moves down the z-axis.

t = Teleport to random location.
w = Stay where you are and pass turns until you complete the level or die.
    You get a 10% bonus to score for each robot who dies in this period,
    but it only counts if you complete the level.
s = Toggle "sticky" mode, in which your view stays fixed on the current
    elevation even when you move. Sticky mode is indicated by the presence of
    an "s" at the bottom of the info pane.
q = Quit.

Pg-up = View next level on z-axis, without moving.
Pg-dn = View previous level on z-axis, without moving.
p = View level on z-axis on which player is placed, without moving.
g = Prompt for number of level on z-axis and view that level, without moving.

OPTIONS

  -h, --help            show help message and exit
  -c FILE, --config FILE
                        provide a custom configuration file
  -l LEVEL, --level LEVEL
                        start playing at the specified level
  -n NAME, --name NAME  specify player name
  -x N                  specify length on x-axis of grid
  -y N                  specify length on y-axis of grid
  -z N                  specify length on z-axis of grid

If you provide options that affect gameplay (ie pretty much any option other
than name), the score achieved in the ensuing game will not be recorded in the
high scores. This is so even if the values provided for the options are the
same as the default ones.
