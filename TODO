TODO ASAP:

- Find a sensible place to store gfx files.

- Man page outlining options and controls.

- Proper high scores system, similar to bsd-robots or nethack.
  Game belongs to "games" group and can write to central scorefile in
  /var/games or whatever.

- Proper logging.

- Advanced start, with bonus (-a).

- Teleport when necessary (-t).
