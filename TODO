TODO ASAP:

- Scalable system for supporting and configuring multiple control sets.

  - Clean up the way each interface interacts with ControlSet.

  - Saving and loading control sets.

- Packaging for various operating systems.

  - .deb

  - .rpm

  - Windows (this is complicated; cx_freeze doesn't work; consider using
    py2exe or distutils.command.bdist_msi)

  - Mac

- Man page outlining options and controls.

- Proper high scores system, similar to bsd-robots or nethack.
  Game belongs to "games" group and can write to central scorefile in
  /var/games or whatever.

- Proper logging.

- Advanced start, with bonus (-a).

- Teleport when necessary (-t).
