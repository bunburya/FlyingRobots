TODO ASAP:

- Moving as far as is safe.

- If you die while waiting, you currently get all the points associated with
  killing the robots who died during the waiting period, but don't get the bonus
  points. You shouldn't get any points for kills during that period if you die.

- Proper game over screen, including prompt to play again.

- Jump to an arbitrary elevation.

- Merge Grid classes into one.

- Clean up code.

- Better high scores.
  - Limit how many high scores are saved (10 or 20).
  - Better algo for inserting score in correct position; function should also
    return player's position.
  - High scores must be loaded fresh every time we want to add one.

- Revamp config system; game should use hardcoded values unless --config option
  is supplied. Only standard games (ones without custom configs) should count
  towards high scores.

- Option parsing.

- Documentation.
