TODO ASAP:

- Collision handling has to be completely overhauled.
  Currently, each tile can only hold one value so where two robots overlap
  temporarily (ie before one has the chance to move away), only one is stored
  on the tile, and when it moves away the tile is marked as empty.
  Consider a solution where tiles can hold multiple values, or there is some
  collection, global to the Grid class, that holds this data.
  Also, BaseGrid._set_tile is doing too much; we have to separate it out into
  different functions, to be called in different places.
  
  Possible solution: moving, colliding etc doesn't involve manipulation of the
  grid, only of the objects involved (coords, is_alive etc). Then, after all
  the moving and colliding is done, the objects are painted to the grid
  according to their new attributes.

- More advanced info grid.

- Proper game over screen, including prompt to play again.

- More robots/more sensible calculation.

- Jump to an arbitrary elevation.

- Fast robots.

- Merge Grid classes into one.
