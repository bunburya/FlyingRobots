TODO ASAP:

- Moving as far as is safe.

- Proper game over screen, including prompt to play again.

- Jump to an arbitrary elevation.

- Merge Grid classes into one.

- Clean up code.

- Revamp config system; game should use hardcoded values unless --config option
  is supplied. Only standard games (ones without custom configs) should count
  towards high scores.

- Documentation.

- Proper logging.
